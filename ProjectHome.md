With our tool we want to offer an on-demand service for users that want to gather software analytics for their own projects or for a wide set of open-source projects whose metrics are stored in our database (DB). In the first case the user may have to wait a while before having software analytics available while for the latter set of projects fetching information from our DB to generate visualizations requires negligible time.
